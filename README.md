# Unit 3 JavaScript: Password Generator

### **Project Descirption**
This project takes user input from javascript prompts and uses this info to make a password display in the generated password field on a HTML file. It takes in password length, weather the user wants uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers and spits out a password that is random and uses all of the user specified criteria. 

The most challenging part of this project was the randomizing part. I was able to get the arrays of the characters to join an empty array pretty easily but randomizing that new array was tough.
